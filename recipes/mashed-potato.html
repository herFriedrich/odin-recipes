    <h2>What to expect</h2>
    <p>Eastern-style mashed potatoes bring a flavorful twist to a classic comfort food. Creamy and fluffy, these mashed potatoes are infused with roasted garlic, tangy yogurt or labneh, and a drizzle of olive oil for richness. A hint of cumin or sumac adds an earthy or citrusy note that sets this dish apart. Whether served alongside grilled meats, vegetables, or enjoyed on their own with warm flatbread, these mashed potatoes are hearty, aromatic, and satisfying. They're a delicious, wholesome way to elevate a familiar favorite with bold regional flavors.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds (about 4–5 medium) russet or Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>½ cup plain yogurt or labneh (Greek yogurt works too)</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra virgin olive oil (plus more for drizzling)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin (optional)</li>
        <li>Optional: ½ teaspoon sumac or paprika for garnish</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or dill for garnish (optional)</li>
    <h3>How...</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Cook the Potatoes and Garlic
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Sauté onion until soft (about 5 minutes), then add minced garlic and cook for 1 more minute.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef (or beef/pork mix) and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon.</li>
                <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using).</li>
                <li>Simmer uncovered on low heat for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally. This lets the flavors deepen and the sauce thicken.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Mash the Potatoes
            <ol>
                <li>Mash the potatoes and garlic together using a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth.</li>
                <li>Stir in the yogurt (or labneh) and olive oil, mixing well.</li>
                <li>Season with salt, pepper, and cumin (if using), adjusting to taste.</li>
                <li>For an ultra-smooth texture, you can use a hand mixer or food processor.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Garnish and Serve
            <ol>
                <li>Transfer mashed potatoes to a serving dish.</li>
                <li>Drizzle with a little extra olive oil on top.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with sumac or paprika, and garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or dill if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve warm — perfect with grilled kebabs, stews, or roasted vegetables.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br>        
    </ul>
