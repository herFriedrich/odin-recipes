    <h2>What to expect</h2>
    <p>Few dishes evoke the warmth and comfort of a homemade lasagna, and this one is the ultimate crowd-pleaser. Layer upon layer of rich, savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and perfectly cooked pasta come together in a bubbling, cheesy masterpiece. The hearty ragu, slowly simmered with garlic, onions, and Italian herbs, seeps into every bite, while the blend of mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan delivers a gooey, golden top that’s irresistible. Each forkful is a balanced bite of tender noodles, melty cheese, and robust flavor — the kind of meal that brings everyone to the table and keeps them coming back for seconds.</p>

    <h3>How...</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Sauté onion until soft (about 5 minutes), then add minced garlic and cook for 1 more minute.</li>

                <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using).</li>
                <li>Simmer uncovered on low heat for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally. This lets the flavors deepen and the sauce thicken.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Step 2: Prepare the Cheese Filling

                <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan, parsley (optional), salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Mix well until smooth and set aside.Mix well until smooth and set aside.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Step 3: Cook the Noodles (skip this if using no-boil noodles)
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
                <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
                <li>Drain and lay them flat on a towel or lightly oiled surface to prevent sticking.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Step 4: Assemble the Lasagna
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Place a layer of noodles over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Add a layer of meat sauce, then sprinkle with mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Repeat layers (noodles → ricotta → sauce → mozzarella) two more times.</li>
                <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, remaining sauce, and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Step 5: Bake the Lasagna
            <ol>
                <li>Cover with foil (to prevent cheese from burning) and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove foil and bake for another 20–25 minutes, or until bubbly and golden on top.</li>
                <li>Let it rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing. This helps it hold its shape.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        
    </ul>
